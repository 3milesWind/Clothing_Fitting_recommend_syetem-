# Clothing_Fitting_recommend_syetem
#### The goal of this project is to provide a general approach to clothing fit prediction, given some usersâ€™ unwillingness to disclose information such as weight, bust size, age, body typed, etc. for privacy concerns. Instead,We collect and analyze existing data, analyze and make a corresponding recommendation system. First, we Applied EDA, regressions, SMVs analyzes data and predicted the clothes styles users preferred. Then Used Bags-of-words to analyze the user's Evaluation tendency to choose in different environments. Finally, create a multilayer neural network with 128 input units, 2 layers of 256 hidden ReLU units, and a Sigmoid output layer.

#### conlusion:Our baseline model received a BER of 0.285, while our prediction model got a BER of 0.249. Alternatively, if we only use model part (a) for prediction, we would get a BER of 0.256, and if we only use model part (b) for prediction, we would get a BER of 0.273.The overall model offers marginal improvement on part (a) performing individually but substantial improvement over part (b) performing individually (2.7% and 8.7% respectively in terms of BER) and the baseline model (an improvement of 12%).
